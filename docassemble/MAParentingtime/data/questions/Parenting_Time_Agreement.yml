question: |
  Parenting Time Agreement
subquestion: |
  Because children do best when both parents have a stable and meaningful involvement in their lives, the goal of this form is to help you design a plan that supports contact between each child and both parents. Parents are encouraged to share in the rights and responsibilities of raising their children after the parents have separated or divorced. This form is designed to be used for parents to develop their own parenting plan to submit to the Court for consideration.
